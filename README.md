# Helm

Helm is a package manager for kubernetes like apt,yum, So it used to ("package" Yaml files) and "push" them into public or private repositories

## Lifecycle management with Helm 
 each time we pull a chart and install it a release which is "your application or a package or collections of kubernetes objects" is created  
 and revision is the upgrade that happened in each release like update an image and so on .


## Difference between Helm2 and Helm3
**Helm2:** Consists of CLIENT (helm cli) when ever you deploy a helm chart,then helm client will send the "yaml files" to tillers that actually run  in a kubernetes cluster.And SERVER (Tiller) that run in a kubernetes cluster and executes the request that send from "helm cli" and create a component from this yaml files inside kubernetes cluster  
**Helm3:** Delete Tiller becouse it consumped a lot of power inside kubernetes cluster

## Installation

From Homebrew (macOS)

```bash
brew install helm
```

## Helm is useful in:

"templating engine": 
      if you have many microservices in your cluster and each of them has it's "deployment and service " and almost the same values
      So each dynamic values will replaced by palceholders and that will be a "Template file" and each value in yaml file "Template file" 
      take the value from external configuration yaml file called "values.yaml" ex:  name: {{ .Values.name }} 
      
## Helm Chart:
"Bundle of yaml files" and it created using (helm) and pushing them to "helm repositorie" to be available

## Helm Chart structure: 

mychart/ : name of chart

Chart.yaml: meta info about chart ex: name , dependencies , version

values.yaml: are the default values for the template file 

charts/ : chart dependencies if this chart depend on other chart this chart will define here

templates/ : the actual template files

## Helm Commands:
```bash
# create helm chart
helm create microservice-release
# testing purpose >> see your release with its values before deployed
helm template ./webapp/
# list all releases
helm list
# history of partuclar releases
helm history microservice-release
# rollback to previous release 
helm rollback microservice-release 1      ...>> number of revision
```

## Functions in helm 

Functions in helm help transform data from one format to another.
So what we need here is a simple way for our chart to have some default values that it can fall back on in case the users donâ€™t provide anything in their values. yaml file we can do such a thing using "functions" 

The details about arguments that a function takes can be found in the Helm documentation pages.
 - [Functions in helm](https://helm.sh/docs/chart_template_guide/function_list/)
 
```go 
  # this relase had its value from values defined in the values.yaml file
  {{ .Values.image.repository }}     >>     image: nginx
  # if the user didn't enter a value please, provide a default value using default func.
  {{ default "nginx" .Values.image.repository }}     >>     image: nginx
  
  # Another example of using function in helm
  {{ .Values.image.tag | upper | quote }}     >>     name: "NGINX"
```
