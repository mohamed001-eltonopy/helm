# Helm

**Helm:** is a package manager for kubernetes like apt,yum, So it used to ("package" Yaml files) and "push" them into public or private repositories

## Lifecycle management with Helm 
 Each time we pull a chart and install it a release which is "your application or a package or collections of kubernetes objects" is created  
 and revision is the upgrade that happened in each release like update an image and so on .


## Difference between Helm2 and Helm3
**Helm2:** Consists of CLIENT (helm cli) when ever you deploy a helm chart,then helm client will send the "yaml files" to tillers that actually run in a kubernetes cluster.And SERVER (Tiller) that run in a kubernetes cluster and executes the request that send from "helm cli" and create a component from this yaml files inside kubernetes cluster  
**Helm3:** Delete Tiller becouse it consumped a lot of power inside kubernetes cluster

## Installation

From Homebrew (macOS)
```bash
brew install helm
```

## Helm is useful in:

**"templating engine"**: 
      if you have many microservices in your cluster and each of them has it's "deployment and service " and almost the same values
      So each dynamic values will replaced by palceholders and that will be a "Template file" and each value in yaml file "Template file" 
      take the value from external configuration yaml file called "values.yaml" ex:  name: {{ .Values.name }} 
      
## Helm Chart:
"Bundle of yaml files" and it created using (helm) and pushing them to "helm repositorie" to be available

## Helm Chart structure: 

**mychart/** : name of chart

**Chart.yaml**: meta info about chart ex: name , dependencies , version

**values.yaml**: are the default values for the template file 

**charts/** : chart dependencies if this chart depend on other chart this chart will define here

**templates/** : the actual template files

## Helm Commands:
```bash
# create helm chart
helm create microservice-release
# testing purpose >> see your release with its values before deployed
helm template ./webapp/
#Try to dry-run the microservice-release chart now.
helm install microservice-release /root/microservice-release/ --dry-run
# list all releases
helm list
# history of partuclar releases
helm history microservice-release
# rollback to previous release 
helm rollback microservice-release 1      ...>> number of revision

```

## Functions in helm 

Functions in helm help transform data from one format to another.
So what we need here is a simple way for our chart to have some default values that it can fall back on in case the users donâ€™t provide anything in their values. yaml file we can do such a thing using "functions" 
The details about arguments that a function takes can be found in the Helm documentation pages.
 - [Functions in helm](https://helm.sh/docs/chart_template_guide/function_list/)
 
```go 
  # this relase had its value from values defined in the values.yaml file
  {{ .Values.image.repository }}     >>     image: nginx
  # if the user didn't enter a value please, provide a default value using default func.
  {{ default "nginx" .Values.image.repository }}     >>     image: nginx
  
  # Another example of using function in helm
  {{ .Values.image.tag | upper | quote }}     >>     name: "NGINX"
```
## Conditionals

We want to conditionally add these lines depending upon whether the variable was defined or no in helm chart 
 - [Conditions in helm](https://helm.sh/docs/chart_template_guide/control_structures/#ifelse)
```go 
  # we can encapsulate the lines that we want to be available in an if conditional block only if the orglabel value is defined.use "-" to ride of spaces
  # If the orglabel value is not set in the values.yaml file, then orglabel won't be available in the output file either.
  {{- if .Values.orgLabel }}
  labels:
     org: {{ .Values.orgLabel }} 
  {{- end }}
  
  #We have if, else if, and else statements in if conditional blocks, in Helm charts 
  {{- if .Values.orgLabel }}
  labels:
     org: {{ .Values.orgLabel }} 
  {{- else if eq .Values.orgLabel "hr" }}  
      org: human resources 
  {{ else }}
     org: business
  {{- end }}
  
  # the common examples whether to create objects of a certain kinds like serviceaccount or not.I want to provide an option for the user 
  # to customize the creation of the service account based on a setting in the values.yaml file.
  # I add a section called service account with a field create set to true, and I only want to create the service account if this field is set to true.
  {{- if .Values.serviceAccount.create }}
  apiVersion: v1
  kind: ServiceAccount
  metadata:
    name: {{ .Release.Name }}
  {{- end }}
  
```
```go 
apiVersion: v1
metadata:
  name: {{ .Values.configMap.name }}
  namespace: default
kind: ConfigMap
data:
  {{- if eq .Values.environment "production" }}
    APP_COLOR: pink
  {{- else if eq .Values.environment "development" }}
    APP_COLOR: darkblue
  {{- else }}
    APP_COLOR: green
  {{- end }}
```

## With block to specify a scope:

use with block when everything falls under the same scope 
- [Flow Control in helm](https://helm.sh/docs/chart_template_guide/control_structures/#modifying-scope-using-with)

```go 
apiVersion: v1
kind: ConfigMap
metadata:
  name: {{ .Values.Release.Name }}
data:
  {{- with .Values.app }}
    {{- with .ui  }} 
      background: {{ .bg }}
      forground: {{ .fg }}
    {{- end }}
    {{- with .db  }}
      database: {{ .name }}
      connection: {{ .conn }}
    {{- end }}
  // As The release object is in the root scope, so the only way to access it is using $ that will take you all the way to the root
  release: {{ $.Release.Name }}   
  {{- end }}
```

## Ranges
Looping with the range action to provide a "for each"-style loop.
- [Looping with the range in helm](https://helm.sh/docs/chart_template_guide/control_structures/#looping-with-the-range-action)

```go 
apiVersion: v1
kind: ConfigMap
metadata:
  name: {{ .Values.Release.Name }}
data:
// we want to list the regions values that defined inside values.yaml in the form of a list or an array with each region inside a quote.
   regions: 
   {{- range .Values.regions }}
   - {{ . | quote }}
   {{- end }}
   
```
```go
{{- with .Values.serviceAccount.create }}
apiVersion: v1
kind: ServiceAccount
metadata:
  name: {{ $.Values.serviceAccount.name }}
  labels:
    {{- range $.Values.serviceAccount.labels }}
    tier: {{ . }}
    {{- end }}
    app: webapp-color
{{- end }}
```
